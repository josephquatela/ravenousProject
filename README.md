# ravenous

## App info

Have you ever just wished yelp was a different color? Well, now it's yellow! This ReactJS based web-app allows users to search their for food in a specified location.
This app helped me learn about the React framework, as well as basic API usage. 

Check out the code to see how it works, or visit `quatelaravenousapp.surge.sh` to try the hosted version.

Enjoy!
